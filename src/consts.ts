  about:
    "My artwork allows me to express myself and share with others appreciation for Godâ€™s creation, especially mountains and oceans. I grew up in Illinois, but frequently visited Colorado with my family. Rocky Mountain scenes are especially close to my heart, but Florida beaches and midwest landscapes are also special to me. I want people who see my artwork to have a sense of calm and contentment when they see my paintings.",
